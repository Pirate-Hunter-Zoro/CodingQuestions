# About this Repository
*These three classes, in Python, C++, and Java, are solutions to various coding challenge questions. They are the joint effort of Mikey Ferguson and Julian Abhari!*
## Instructions
*It doesn't really make sense to run this - using three separate languages, all we did was practice coding questions. As such, this repository is for us to organize our work, so if you feel so inspired you are welcome to look at our coding solutions to various problems.*
